        The second payment is made after all features pass evaluation and meet contractual requirements.

**Dedicated Development**: Flexible collaboration with tailored adjustments.  

- **Concurrent Design**  
    Development begins immediately after signing, participating in design discussions to improve efficiency.  
- **Requirement Adjustments**  
    Feature changes are evaluated for timeline impact, with recommendations implemented upon mutual agreement.  
- **Payment Model**:  
    - **Contract Signing Payment**  
        Pay the current month's fee upon signing. If progress does not meet commitments, a refund or early termination can be negotiated.  
    - **Payment Cycle**:  
        - **Signed 1-15**  
            Next month's fee is due by the 15th of the following month.  
        - **Signed 16-31**  
            Next month's fee is due by the 1st of the following month.  

**Payment and Refund Policy**: Comprehensive protection.
