**One-Time Development**: Payments are made in stages to ensure your interests are protected.  

- **Requirement Confirmation**  
    All feature and interface requirements must be finalized before signing the contract. Design-while-developing is not offered.  
- **Requirement Changes**  
    Changes or new features are handled only after project completion and final payment. Scope and pricing will be re-confirmed.  
- **Stage Payments**:  
    - **Contract Signing: 50%**  
        A deposit initiates development. If requirements are not met after two evaluations (based on completion or defined scope), a refund or early termination can be negotiated.  
    - **Completion Review: 40%**  
        The second payment is made after all features pass evaluation and meet contractual requirements.  
    - **Deployment: 10%**  
        The final payment is due within seven days of stable post-deployment operation.  

**Dedicated Development**: Flexible collaboration with tailored adjustments.  

- **Concurrent Design**  
    Development begins immediately after signing, participating in design discussions to improve efficiency.  
- **Requirement Adjustments**  
    Feature changes are evaluated for timeline impact, with recommendations implemented upon mutual agreement.  
- **Payment Model**:  
    - **Contract Signing Payment**  
        Pay the current month's fee upon signing. If progress does not meet commitments, a refund or early termination can be negotiated.  
    - **Payment Cycle**:  
        - **Signed 1-15**  
            Next month's fee is due by the 15th of the following month.  
        - **Signed 16-31**  
            Next month's fee is due by the 1st of the following month.  

**Payment and Refund Policy**: Comprehensive protection.  

- If project features fail to meet expectations, free adjustments will be provided until they conform to requirements.  
- If standards are still unmet, partial refunds based on incomplete feature proportions will be arranged after mutual agreement, ensuring fair protection.
