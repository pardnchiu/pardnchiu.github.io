## One-time Development

- **What is requirement freezing?**  
   All functionality and interface requirements must be clearly defined before signing the contract, including detailed designs. After signing, the confirmed requirement list will be final, and no additions or modifications will be accepted.  
- **How are additional feature requests handled?**  
   If additional requests arise, they will be arranged for subsequent development based on urgency and schedule after the project is completed and the final payment is made.  
- **What are the acceptance criteria for one-time development?**  
   Acceptance is based on the functionalities and interface requirements listed in the contract, ensuring all agreed-upon items are fully met.  
- **Can urgent development be accommodated?**  
   Urgent projects are supported depending on the current workload. An urgency fee equal to 1.5 times the total project cost will apply, subject to prior discussion.  
- **Is installment payment supported?**  
   Apart from clearly defined phased payment plans, additional installment options must be negotiated before signing the contract. Flexible payment schedules can be arranged for long-term projects based on progress.  
- **How are major feature omissions after the project launch handled?**  
   A one-year unlimited bug fix warranty is provided. If the omission is within the scope of the contract, it will be implemented for free. If it is a new requirement, it will be re-evaluated and quoted accordingly.

## Dedicated Development

- **What is the scope of design involvement?**  
   Professional suggestions will be provided during the design process, but the design work itself will not be handled directly. The final design version will be confirmed by both parties before development begins.  
- **How are feature changes handled?**  
   Feature changes are flexibly adjusted depending on the impact: minor changes can be implemented directly, while major changes require an impact assessment and negotiation for extended timelines and costs.  
- **How is the development progress ensured?**  
   Milestone-based monthly progress is agreed upon, and the acceptance criteria focus on whether the delivered functionalities meet the planned development goals, ensuring measurable progress.  
- **How are payment cycles handled for end-of-month contracts?**  
   If the contract is signed near the end of the month, the payment cycle will be adjusted accordingly. For example, contracts signed at the end of the month will require the next month's payment by the 1st to ensure alignment of timelines and payments.  
- **What is the communication process during development?**  
   A dedicated project manager will be assigned, and weekly progress reports will be provided (or adjusted as per client requirements). All requirement changes must be confirmed in writing to ensure transparency and efficiency during the development process.

## Other

- **How is data security ensured?**  
   SSL/TLS encryption is used for transmission, and all client data is only used for development and deleted after delivery.  
- **Is multilingual support provided?**  
   Multilingual development is supported, but language requirements must be confirmed and quoted during the initial project phase.  
- **Does technical support include training?**  
   General technical support covers system maintenance and bug fixes. Additional paid services can be provided for training or functionality demonstrations.  
- **Does bug fixing include issues with third-party modules or plugins?**  
   Maintenance services focus on core functionality developed in-house. For third-party plugin issues affecting the system, solutions will be suggested but not directly handled.  
- **What defines a new feature?**  
   New features are limited to simple functions not included in the contract, such as adding a button, form validation, or data field. Large modules (e.g., e-commerce systems or multilingual support) are excluded.  
- **Is maintenance support provided?**  
   Development delivery is prioritized, and a one-year unlimited bug fix warranty is included to ensure stable operation after project completion.  
   For feature updates, a separate warranty contract covering new features must be signed to ensure continuous development support.  
- **How are delays during development handled?**  
   Delays caused by communication or external factors will be negotiated based on the actual situation, with schedules updated and progress and costs reconfirmed.  
- **Who owns the deliverables after development completion?**  
   All code and related documentation will be handed over upon completion. Ownership will fully belong to the client, with necessary handover instructions provided.
